# ground-guide-gesture-dataset

Welcome to the `ground-guide-gesture-dataset` repository. This repo contains the Ground Guide Gesture Dataset implemented as a custom PyTorch Dataset.

The dataset was created with 74 videos from 5 participants making 10 gestures from the U.S. Army Training Circular 3-21.60 "Signals to Control Vehicle Drivers." The 11th gesture, _STANDBY_, captures all non-gestures. The dataset was used in training Ground Guide Gesture Detection Models as part of a final project in my Case Studies in Machine Learning course.
